i   : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  9  10 11
F(i): 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89

Induction base:
n = 1
sum(Fi) i from 0 to 1 = F0 + F1 = 0 + 1
Fi+2 - 1 = F3 - 1 = 2 - 1

Induction shift:
k = n + 1:

sum(Fi) i from 0 to n+1 = F0 + ... + Fn + Fn+1 =? Fn+3 - 1

we know that sum(Fi) i from 0 to n = F0 + ... + Fn = Fn+2 - 1
and that Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

(0) Fn+3 = Fn+2 + Fn+1
(1) Fn+3 - Fn+2 = Fn+1

(2) F0 + ... + Fn = Fn+2 - 1 -> F0 + ... + Fn + Fn+1 = Fn+2 - 1 + Fn+3 - Fn+2

F0 + ... + Fn+1 = Fn+3 - 1
